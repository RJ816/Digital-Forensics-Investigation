    While file timestamps are easily modified in Windows, Timeline can give a comprehensive file history assuming timestamps were not altered. 
    It can be shown that proprietary data was obtained and deleted ($CarvedFiles) on 08/11/2021. 
    Mike Morris is shown to be the owner of the proprietary files.

    On 08/12/2021, Numerous articles on the topics of covert cryptocurrency transactions were similarly treated, along with more propriety data.

    Proprietary data was clearly accessed by John Smith from 8/11/21-8/13/21. 
    Morris could have been the target of Mr. Smith&#39;s social engineering attack or complicit with the unauthorized access. 
    Guides on covert bitcoin transactions imply incentive to sell the proprietary data to an outside source. 
    If the hidden string is an email, it could be tied with attempts to receive cryptocurrency or contact an anonymous buyer. 
    + alias in emails is a common way to produce multiple forwarding emails, and custom email domains can be obtained at a relatively low cost. 
    To make any conclusive ties to any of the above theories, company email servers should be searched for any communications to the email address found. 
    The timeline analysis would support the theory of Mr. Johnson copying the proprietary data to sell once cryptocurrency payment was complete. 
    The evidence is only conclusive of unauthorized access by Mr. Smith, 
    so at the very least he is in violation of the companies AUPs along with possibly the cryptocurrency articles. 
    Selling the proprietary data would breach the NDA agreement, but current evidence is indeterminate and further analysis should be conducted on other relevant devices.
